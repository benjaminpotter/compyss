# compyss
A tool built for analysing skylight polarization patterns. It aims to provide
heading information from skylight angle of polarization images.

### Design philosophy
compyss is designed to be as flexible as possible. It's flexibility allows it to
support multiple cameras and decode methods. Once you write a decoder, it should
be available for all supported cameras. See the wiki for more information.

### Author
This package was written in conjuction with a study at [Queen's
University](https://queensu.ca/) at Kingston. If you use this code, please cite
our work. We have not published yet, but when we do I will link the citation

## Features
- Read angle to solar meridian from AoLP image

### Camera SDK support
- Lucid Vision Labs, Arena SDK

## Usage
Examples are provided in the source. The general flow is 

```
import compyss.core
from compyss.sources.file import FileSource

# create a new compass object
cmps = compyss.core.Compass(source=FileSource("path/to/file.png")

# use the compass object to extract data from the source
cmps.read()
```

### Initial setup
The package is not currently available on pypi. Download the source and install
as a local package using pip.

### Dependencies
General dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``` or something similar.

Camera sources require specific dependencies that do not apply globally. Using the available camera sources requires installing their interface. 
For example, LUCID Vision cameras require the ArenaSDK to be installed. See [wiki](https://github.com/benjaminpotter/compyss/wiki/Sources#camera-specific-dependencies)
for more info.

## FAQ
For questions, open an issue or send an email to ben [dot] potter [at] queensu

## Projects
If you use this code, open a PR and add your project to this list. We also ask
you cite our paper. See [author](#author).

## Contributing 
Contributions are welcome, mostly with respect to camera SDK support. If you need support for another camera SDK,
reach out to me ben [dot] potter [at] queensu [dot] ca.

### Potential Updates
- Create an ImageDecoder class that standardizes decoder format. Package user should create a decoder object and pass it to the compass object similar to the ImageSource class.
- Change examples/solar_meridian.py to examples/load_from_file.py to better highlight the purpose of that example.
